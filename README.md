NeuroLearn AI predicts which concepts a student is about to struggle with, explains why in plain language, traces the root cause back to the prerequisite that is really missing, and generates a personalised learning path to fix it. Faculty get a cohort view that flags at-risk students early so they can intervene before grades drop.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/VIswendrachoudary/NeuroLearn-AI.git
cd NeuroLearn-AI

# 2. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in JWT_SECRET and ML_API_KEY

# 3. Start the database
docker compose up -d db

# 4. Verify the database is running
docker compose exec db psql -U neurolearn -c 'select version();'
```

Full setup instructions (ML service, backend, frontend) will be added after each phase is complete.
